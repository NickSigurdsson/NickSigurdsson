### Hi there 👋

I'm Nicholas, a Software Analyst at Miipe Inc., where I contribute to building a robust test automation platform to accelerate software delivery and improve QA efficiency. I work across Agile, Waterfall, and DevOps environments to design test cases for SFT, UAT, DVT, and ORT, and support performance testing and automation framework design.

Previously, I engineered enterprise-grade desktop and web applications at **Exco Technologies** using .NET Core, WPF, WinForms, and ASP.NET. My work there included:
- Automating hardware design workflows with Siemens NX Open, reducing ejector pin integration time by **97%**
- Creating modular WPF tooling integrated with SQL databases and the Epicor ERP system
- Improving development speed by **40%** with a reusable NX Open function library

In my previous role as a Founding Software Engineer at **HolisticMind AI**, I built HIPAA-compliant, secure FastAPI + PostgreSQL backends deployed on AWS (EC2, S3, RDS). I also:
- Built a data ingestion pipeline to train domain-specific LLMs using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique
- Supported frontend state persistence using PostgreSQL and session management techniques

### 🧠 Currently exploring:
- 🔭 Building an **automated equity trading system** to optimize my day trading strategies using data-driven execution models
- 📚 Actively learning machine learning fundamentals, DSA, and CUDA/GPU computing to deepen my low-level systems and AI development expertise

### 🚀 Hackathons & Projects
- 🛠️ **Skill4Skill** – Built a full-stack monolithic Node.js backend with secure JWT-based authentication, custom Mongoose schemas, and observability using AWS CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Datadog APM
- 🧠 **DigiSpotter** – Hack the North 2022 winning project: an iOS app built with SwiftUI + ARKit to track and correct workout posture in real-time using body motion analysis
